Dear friend!

Now you have your new MiTail or EarGear, I wanted to write out some important advice to remember when
wearing them. As fun as they are, they are not indestructible. So to avoid upset, please follow the advice
below.

### MiTail

Servos are the little motors inside your gear that make it move.
There are some things you should never do to your gear because it will damage those servos. Broken
servos mean more noise when it moves or moves becoming erratic. Worse still, it could mean a broken tail
or ears, and replacement costs. All of these are important!

1. Much as it would be lovely, you can’t wrap the tail around you! It may break the servos,
and it almost certainly will damage the case. Your tail is meant to be worn in the D-Clip and
project out from the body. Breaking the case means a trip to our studio for repairs and the
cost of a new case. Sitting down in a chair, without removing the tail, can break the
case! The tail is designed to be removable to prevent that damage on the case.
2. It’s tempting to use your tail for hours and hours. But it’s not a good idea to run your gear
all day without building in pauses and breaks. These pauses help reduce wear, keep the
MiTail insides nice and cool, and prolong the tails’ life. Every hour, take a moment to let
your gear relax. MiTail moves in a lovely way even unpowered. So, build these moments in
to your session to keep your tail healthy.
3. Never let your tail constantly bang into something as its moving. In fact, anything that stops
the tail from moving is not good. It might not damage the tail right away, but over time, it will
shorten the life of your tail and may cause permanent damage.
4. MiTails are designed to lift only the weight of the cover, nothing else. That chainmail
cover you wanted to make? It’ll break the poor tail. What about the jewel encrusted Tail Tip
you’ve got planned? Unless we have spoken to you about it, it’s a bad idea and will damage
your tail!
5. Say you're dancing, and your tail is wagging too, imagine the combined stress on the tails’
servos! It can be enormous, with your moves in opposition to what the tail is doing. Your tail
may not survive it. When dancing or running, switch off your tail. Otherwise, it may not be up
to much afterwards.

### EarGear

The servos in EarGear are much smaller than those in MiTail. Each one can move the ear happily
with its cover on. But there are some things you should do to keep them happy.
1. Never turn the ears by hand! If you do, you can grind off the part inside the servo that makes it turn.
Always move your ears with the app!
2. EarGear is only designed to move the covers we make. If you add lots of weight, you risk damaging
them. So those metal horns you want to add? Be very careful, and best talk to us first before you
add them.
3. If something gets stuck underneath the ear, please remove it first before continuing to use your
ears.
If you follow this advice, your gear will last a very long time.

Best wishes
